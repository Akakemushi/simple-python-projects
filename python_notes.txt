- pip is the package installer for Python. pip allows you to install additional Python libraries and packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI).
  It's useful for managing dependencies in Python projects. With pip, you can install packages like NumPy, Django, Flask, etc., by running commands
  such as       pip install package_name.
- to run python programs, do   python3   followed by the filename in the command line
- REPL  stands for  Read  Evaluate  Print  Loop,  and it's a way to execute python code typed into the console and get immediate results.
- To initiate REPL,   simply type   "python3"  with nothing after it in the console.  To exit,  either do ctrl + D  or type "exit()"
- BUT!  There is a BETTER version of REPL, which is running    "ipython3"  which gives you stuff like remembering previous commands, using tab, etc.
  Exiting ipython3 is the same as the previous.
- Python is NOT as smart as Ruby, and does not assume that a string + an integer = a string (implicitly converting the integer into a string for you.)



SYNTAX NOTES
printscreen =   print("")  single quotes also work.   integers without any quotes also work.
operators =  same as usual, but there is ORDER OF OPERATION in python, and priority is as follows from top to bottom...
              ( ) parentheses.  Things inside of parentheses are evaluated first.
              **  exponent
              %  modulus (aka remaineder)
              //  Integer division/floored quotient  (it's just division, but it drops the remainder, if one exists (aka rounds down))
              /   division
              *   multiplication
              -   subtraction
              +   addition
              SO  as an example,  7 - 3 ** 2  evaluates to -2, not 16, because the exponent is evaluated FIRST.
              You can also STACK exponents, so 2 ** 2 ** 4  evaluates to 65536 (huge), not 256.  The last exponent is evaluated and THEN the result is
              treated as the exponent to the next exponent.
